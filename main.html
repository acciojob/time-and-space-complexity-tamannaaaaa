	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is how long an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of input. It also tells how time efficient an algorithm is.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is how much memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the size of the input. To create an array of size n, it will take o(n) space complexity</p>
